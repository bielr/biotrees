This package contains four Python modules containing
* the Shape class and its associated methods and functions,
* the PhyloTree class and its associated methods and functions,
* the Probs module with all the probability functions.
It also contains the HTML documentation of all three Python modules of my own, and an HTML containing a minimal version of instructions for using these modules.
